I protoptyed my site using Figma and created my color palette with Coolors. Before fully diving into this project I introduced myself to HTML, CSS and JavaScript on CodePen by trying different ways to make Navigation bars. Finally, after watching some tutorials, I developed my first responsive website! I plan on updating and improving my site as I learn more about Web Development.',
