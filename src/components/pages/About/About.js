                    <p>Hi, my name is Tess Gompper and I am a current second year student majoring in 
                        computer science at <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/academic/undergrad/ba/"><nobr>McGill University</nobr></a> with an 
                        interest in web and mobile development I am also minoring in  
                        <a href ="https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/undergraduate/cs"><nobr> communications studies </nobr></a>
                        to gain an uderstanding of the impact of communication technologies on people throughout history.<br></br>Originally from Ann Arbor, Michigan, I now
                        live in Montreal and look forward to exploring more of the world. In my spare time 
                        I enjoy hiking and exploring, reading, spending time with my cat, and of course learning more about programming!<br></br> 
                        At McGill I am a member of the Figure Skating Team and can't wait to find more opportunities to be a part of the McGill community.</p>
