                    <p>
                        <p>Hi, my name is Tess Gompper and I am from Ann Arbor, Michigan. Now living in Montreal, I am a current third year student majoring in 
                        computer science at <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/academic/undergrad/ba/"><nobr>McGill University</nobr></a> with an 
                        interest in web, mobile, and data development. I am also minoring in  
                        <a href ="https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/undergraduate/cs"><nobr> communications studies </nobr></a>
                        to gain an uderstanding of the impact of communication technologies on people throughout history.</p>
                        <p>I was first introduced to computer science as a member of my high school Innovative Vehicle Design team. Working with two friends and a mentor from Ford Motor Company 
                        I programmed our vehicles ultrasonic blind spot detector and Inertial Measurment Unit. Being a part of this team
                        taught me to love challenges and trying new things, it also gave me my first experience of being a minority
                        in STEM as a woman. Now, as an executive member of <a href = "https://www.mcwics.com/"><nobr>McWiCS</nobr></a>, and a community member of <a href = "https://rewritingthecode.org/"><nobr>Rewriting the Code</nobr></a>, <a href = "https://www.thewomens.network/"><nobr>The Women's Network</nobr></a> and <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/company/technolgap/?originalSubdomain=ca"><nobr>Technolgap </nobr></a> 
                        I'm always looking for more opportunities to meet and learn from more women in STEM!</p>
                        <p>I pride myself in on being a very creative person, I enjoy drawing and paiting as well as sewing and needlepoint. As a figure skater
                        I get to combine this creativity with precision which I find relates strongly to computer science: though creating something technical and precise 
                        a programmer also gets the opportunity to make something unique and beautiful. This combination of precision and creativity
                        is one of the reasons I fell in love with Computer Science. I also consider myself to be very quick to learn. I am good at following directions 
                        and asking for help which makes me easy to teach. </p>
                        <p>In my spare time I enjoy hiking and exploring, reading, spending time with my cat, and trying out new food spots! I have figure skated almost my whole and 
                        am continuing skating for fun as a member of the McGill Figure Skating team, where I am also VP Events. Throughout high school I worked with 
                        special needs athletes through figure skating as a coach and Unified Partner with Michigan Special Olympics and I volunteered as a mentor with <a href= "https://www.montrealbeyondme.ca/"><nobr>Beyond Me Montreal</nobr></a> working 
                         one-on-one with a child with special needs! </p>
