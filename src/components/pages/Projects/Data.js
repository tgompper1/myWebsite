I protoptyed my site using Figma and created my color palette with Coolors. Before fully diving into this project I introduced myself to HTML, CSS and JavaScript on CodePen by trying different ways to make Navigation bars. Finally, after watching some tutorials, I developed my first responsive website! I plan on updating and improving my site as I learn more about Web Development.',

    description: 'This project was from my first hackathon, hackHer, put on by the Queens Women in Computing group in November of 2020. For this virtual hackathon I worked with 3 other students to create a prototype for an app that would tell users what the best time of each day would be to get outside and enjoy the best weather. Inspired by my own experiences, this app was aimed at students stuck in their dorm all day doing online school who, at the end of the day, woudl come to realize they hadn &apos t gotten any fresh air or sunshine that day. Using android studio and the Open Weather Map API I programmed the part of the app that calculated which time of day had the best weather based on temperature and weather conditions.  ',
